# Export videofiles
A super simple exporter of videofiles (flvs most likely) from VideoBloom.

## Why
I really really love this service (http://videobloom.com) but if you know me,
you know I like to keep backups of my stuff locally if at all possible. This
is no different.

## Usage
Simple, get your feedid from the platform and replace it in the export file.
then run the file. The files will be placed into a "videos" directory in the
current directory.
